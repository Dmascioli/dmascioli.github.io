## Midterm Project

The goal of this project was to implement a complex algorithm using MIPS assembly. 
The problem to solve is from Project Euler. [Project 150](https://projecteuler.net/problem=150){:target="_blank"}


## Final Project

The final project in the course was to implement a single-cycle processor using [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/), a digital circuit simulator.

It's features are:
- 16 instructions
- Instruction and data memory, both holding 256 16-bit instructions
- 8 registers
- LED Hexadecimal display
