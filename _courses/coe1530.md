## Hoteller

Hoteller was the semester-long group project that I particpated in.

### Project goals

Create an application to address hotel management to increase efficiency
- There is a time period where there is no guest in a room; we want to minimize that amount of time since guests are not at the hotel restaurant, ordering room service, or otherwise utilizing the facilities during this time
- Allow hotel managers to know exactly what is happening in their hotel
- Quick and efficient room turnaround to allow guests to check in earlier
