# {{ page.title }}

As conference director for [NAESC](https://naesc.org)'s Engineering Leadership Summit, it was required to create name tags for over 300 attendees. Each name tag had to include everyone's name, major, school, and other conference information that told people where to go. Individually editing these seemed like torture, so I went looking for a solution. I came across the Generator plugin for Inkscape, and after some fiddling, it turned out to be exactly what I needed. I decided to write down the process for doing this because I didn't find a whole lot of documentation, so it took a lot of guessing and checking to get the plugin to work.

## Windows Installation

The original Inkscape Generator extension is based on a bash script which is difficult to get working on Windows. Luckily, I found a port of the extension to Python which makes it work perfectly. 

[Here's a link to that project on Github](https://github.com/butesa/ink-generator-python){:target="_blank"}

Both `generator.inx` and `generator.py` go into the directory `C:\Program Files\Inkscape\share\extensions`. 

After Inkscape is reloaded, you should see a new extension under `Extensions > Export > Generator...`

## Creating the name tag template

When searching for name tag holders on Amazon, I was able to find a pack of 100 for $8.99. These plastic holders can fit inserts of 4in by 2.5in or 100x68mm. The first thing to do is create a new Inkscape drawing and going to 'File > Document Properties' and change the width and height of the image to the size of the inserts.
