As conference director for [NAESC](https://naesc.org)'s Engineering Leadership Summit, it was required to create name tags for over 300 attendees. Each name tag had to include everyone's name, major, school, and other conference information that told people where to go. Individually editing these seemed like torture, so I went looking for a solution. I came across the Generator plugin for Inkscape, and after some fiddingling, it turned out to be exactly what I needed. I decided to write down the process for doing this because I didn't find a whole lot of documentation, so it took a lot of guessing and checking to get the plugin to work.
